As of October 17, 2018, all files are created/modified/deleted using Unity 2018.2.12. 
Please do not use any other version until we are all ready to move to a newer version.

The flag in github is set so that before pushing your branch into the github version, 
you must have downloaded the most recent software. So, create your branch, make your changes locally,
and then before pushing your branch up to github, first make sure any changes on github are integrated
into your new branch. This will hopefully limit the number of changes overwriting other changes.
